# Jane-Street-Blotto
My solution to a variation of the classic Blotto game proposed by Jane Street

There are 10 castles, numbered 1, 2, 3, ... , 10, and worth 1, 2, 3, ... , 10 points respectively. You have 100 soldiers, which you can
allocate between the castles however you wish. Your opponent also (independently) does the same. The number of soldiers on
each castle is then compared, and for each castle, whoever has the most soldiers on that castle wins its points (in the case of a tie,
no one gets points). In a given match, castles are fought in order (starting with castle 1). If at any point a player wins 3 consecutive
castles, that player is automatically awarded all remaining castles.
